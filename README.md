## Tic Tac Toe Analyzer

![tic tac toe image](./tictactoe.jpg)

The goal of this app is to develop an application which takes a tic tac toe board, and outputs who the winner is (if any), or whether it is a draw.

This app works for any n x n board.

The app outputs "draw", when there is no winner, and "unfinished" if the game hasn't been finished.
