## Tic Tac Toe Analyzer

![tic tac toe image](./tictactoe.jpg)

The goal of this app is to develop an application which takes a tic tac toe board, and outputs who the winner is (if any), or whether it is a draw.

This tic tac toe application works for any a n x n board.
It also outputs "draw", when there is no winner, and  "unfinished"  when the game hasn't finished yet.
